# GitLab CI/CD DevOps Pipeline
*Why do you a CI/CD pipeline for this? -> Yesüëç*

<img src="utils/doc/cicd_pipeline.png" alt="Alt Text" width="75%"/>

Note: Pipeline training log file can be heavy, use this command to view quickly: ` get-content C:\your-path-here\training_log.txt -tail 10`

One of the benefit of a CI/CD pipeline is freeing up your machine from building/testing/compiling. You can make changes on your slim and light laptop, push changes to be compiled/built/test on your server or more powerful home PC and don't have to worry about lugging around a clunky and power hungry workstation.
